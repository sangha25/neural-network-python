# Neural Networks Fundamentals in Python

This repository covers code implementations of Neural Networks Fundamentals in Python

This project includes core neural networks implementation with python (3.5). Also, no deep learning framework is consumed such as TensorFlow or Theano.

You can run either NN.py or Vectorization.py. First one runs based on for loops whereas second one runs based on matrices and tensors. BTW, vectorized one speeds performance up radically.
